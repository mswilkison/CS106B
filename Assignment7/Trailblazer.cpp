 * by the given cost function.	The resulting path is then returned as a
 * Vector<Loc> containing the locations to visit in the order in which they
 * would be visited.	If no path is found, this function should report an
 * error.
 *
 * In Part Two of this assignment, you will need to add an additional parameter
 * to this function that represents the heuristic to use while performing the
 * search.  Make sure to update both this implementation prototype and the
 * function prototype in Trailblazer.h.
