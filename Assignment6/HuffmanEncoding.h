 * Usage: Map<ext_char, int> freq = getFrequencyTable(file);
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Given an input stream containing text, calculates the
 * frequencies of each character within that text and stores
 * the result as a Map from ext_chars to the number of times
 * that the character appears.
 *
 * This function will also set the frequency of the PSEUDO_EOF
 * character to be 1, which ensures that any future encoding
 * tree built from these frequencies will have an encoding for
 * the PSEUDO_EOF character.

 * Usage: Node* tree = buildEncodingTree(frequency);
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Given a map from extended characters to frequencies,
 * constructs a Huffman encoding tree from those frequencies
 * and returns a pointer to the root.
 *
 * This function can assume that there is always at least one
 * entry in the map, since the PSEUDO_EOF character will always
 * be present.

 * Usage: encodeFile(source, encodingTree, output);
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Encodes the given file using the encoding specified by the
 * given encoding tree, then writes the result one bit at a
 * time to the specified output file.
 *
 * This function can assume the following:
 *
 *   - The encoding tree was constructed from the given file,
 *     so every character appears somewhere in the encoding
 *     tree.
 *
 *   - The output file already has the encoding table written
 *     to it, and the file cursor is at the end of the file.
 *     This means that you should just start writing the bits
 *     without seeking the file anywhere.

 * Usage: decodeFile(encodedFile, encodingTree, resultFile);
 * --------------------------------------------------------

 * encodeFile function.  You can assume the following:
 *
 *   - The encoding table has already been read from the input
 *     file, and the encoding tree parameter was constructed from
 *     this encoding table.

 *   - The output file is open and ready for writing.

 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Writes a table to the front of the specified output file
 * that contains information about the frequencies of all of
 * the letters in the input text.  This information can then
 * be used to decompress input files once they've been
 * compressed.
 *
 * This function is provided for you.  You are free to modify
 * it if you see fit, but if you do you must also update the

 * can properly read the data back.

 * be used to reconstruct the encoding tree for that file.
